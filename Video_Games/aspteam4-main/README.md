Crystal Hearts is a gem based puzzle game developed as part of the CM2020 Agile Software Project
module at University of London BSC Computer Science Program. The game was developed to be run 
using a browser so that it remains compatible with multiple architectures and devices. It has
been tested on Windows, LINUX, Lenovo Tablets and Xiami cell phones with resolution above 1080i and
it has been tested on Google Chrome and Firefox browsers. 

Game theme is the story of our hearts when faced with the hardships of life. We take random
damage from life and we heal, but sometimes our hearts can turn black from the extreme trauma 
and will require extra care and support to resonate on a higher frequency again. And sometimes we 
find a happy heart that uplifts us naturally.

Game play instructions are provided in the main page

To run the game on a new server:

Install the source code on your platform of choice (you need to have both npm and sqlite3 installed to run it),
run command: "npm install" from within Source directory,
run command: "npm run build-db", 
run command: "npm run start"

This application code follows clean code principles, has been designed to be easy to read and undestand
by programmers, uses object oriented principles and comments are limited to where code meaning is not 
evident and to class headers describing their intended functionality.
